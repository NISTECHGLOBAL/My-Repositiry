        <h1> INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTERS</h1>
        
        <p>
            Introduction: The computer is fast becoming the universal machine of the twenty-first
            century. Early computers were large in size and too expensive to be
            owned by individuals. Thus they were confined to the laboratories and
            few research institutes. They could only be programmed by computer
            engineers. The basic applications were confined to undertaking complex
            calculations in science and engineering. Today, the computer is no
            longer confined to the laboratory. Computers, and indeed, computing
            have become embedded in almost every item we use. Computing is fast
            becoming ubiquitous. Its application transcends science, engineering,
            communication, space science, aviation, financial institutions, social
            sciences, humanities, the military, transportation, manufacturing, the
            extractive industries to mention but a few

        <h2> Definitions of computer</h2>
        <p>
            A computer is basically defined as a tool or machine used
            for processing data to give required information. It is capable of:
            taking input data through the keyboard (input unit), storing the input data in a diskette, hard disk or other medium,  processing it in the central processing unit (CPU) and
            and giving out the result (output) on the screen or the Visual Display
            Unit (VDU).

        <h3> <strong>Methods of Data Processing in computer</strong></h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Manual meth</li>
                <li>The Mechanical method and</li>
                <li>The Computer method</li>


            </ol>
            The following are the three major methods that have been widely used for data processing over the years:
            <br> <br>
            <strong>The Manual Method</strong>
            The manual method of data processing involves the use of chalk, wall,
            pen, pencil and the like. These devices, machines or tools facilitate
            human efforts in recording, classifying, manipulating, sorting and
            presenting data or information. The manual data processing operations
            entail considerable manual efforts. Thus, the manual method is
            cumbersome, tiresome, boring, frustrating and time consuming.
            Furthermore, the processing of data by the manual method is likely to be
            affected by human errors. When there are errors, then the reliability,
            accuracy, neatness, tidiness, and validity of the data would be in doubt.
            The manual method does not allow for the processing of large volumes
            of data on a regular and timely basis.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>The Mechanical Method:</strong> 
            The mechanical method of data processing involves the use of machines such as the typewriter, roneo machines, adding machines and the like.
            These machines facilitate human efforts in recording, classifying, manipulating, sorting and presenting data or information. The
            mechanical operations are basically routine in nature. There is virtually
            no creative thinking. Mechanical operations are noisy, hazardous, error
            prone and untidy. The mechanical method does not allow for the
            processing of large volumes of data continuously and timely.

        <h4> Characteristics of a Computer</h4>
        <p>
            <br>
            <strong>Speed:</strong> The computer can manipulate large data at incredible speed and response time can be very fast.
            <br>
            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Its accuracy is very high and its consistency can be relied upon. Errors committed in computing are mostly due to
            human rather than technological weakness. There are in-built error detecting schemes in the computer.
            <br>
            <strong>Storage:</strong> It has both internal and external storage facilities for holding data and instructions. This capacity varies from one
            machine to the other. Memories are built up in K (Kilo) modules where K=1024 memory locations.
            <br>
            <strong>Automatic:</strong> Once a program is in the computer’s memory, it can run automatically each time it is opened. The individual has little
        
            or no instruction to give again.
            <br>
            <strong>Reliability:</strong> Being a machine, a computer does not suffer human traits of tiredness and lack of concentration. It will perform the
            last job with the same speed and accuracy as the first job every time even if ten million jobs are involved.
            <br>
            <strong>Flexibility:</strong> It can perform any type of task once it can be reduced to logical steps. Modern computers can be used to
            perform a variety of functions like on-line processing, multi- programming, real time processing etc

        <ul>
            <li>TGeneral-purpose computers are more flexible than special
                purpose computers. Thus, the former can handle a wide spectrum
                of problems.</li>
            <li>They have inadequate storage</li>
            <li>They have low operating speed</li>
            <li>Coordination of the various tasks and subsections may take time</li>
